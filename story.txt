Once upon a time there was a boy named Peter. Peter studied at UW Madison and was pursuing a major in computer science. He loved CS300 so he thought of taking up CS400. When he initially entered the class he loved it and everything was going smoothly. Then suddenly one day the professor made an announcement that they would no longer display the scores of the homeworks after each attempt. This made Peter very sad. Initially, Peter would look at his score and realize the questions he got wrong were the ones he was confused on. Now, can't check the score after his first attempt. This makes Peter second guess himself each time he completes the homework. Another thing that bothered Peter is the P2 assignments. Besides implementing a few complicated methods, he has to write commends for more than forty methods.
