Once upon a time there was a boy named Peter. Peter studied at UW Madison and was pursuing a major in computer science. He loved CS300 so he thought of taking up CS400. When he initially entered the class he loved it and everything was going smoothly. Then suddenly one day the professor made an announcement that they would no longer display the scores of the homeworks after each attempt. This made Peter very sad.
